# Tasks #
0. Print a list of integers  
Write a function that prints all integers of a list.  

1. Secure access to an element in a list   
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.  

2. Replace element  
Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).  

3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!  
Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.  

4. Replace in a copy  
Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).  

5. Can you C me now?  
Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.  

6. Lists of lists = Matrix  
Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.  

7. Tuples addition   
Write a function that adds 2 tuples.  

8. More returns!  
Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.  

9. Find the max  
Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.  

10. Only by 2  
Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.  

11. Delete at
