# Overview #
The program codes in this directory are to assist in learning and developing proficiency with Python, specifically with data structures: set and dictionary.  

# General #
0. Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))?  
Because of sets and dictionaries.  

1. What are set and how to use them?  
A set is a data type of unordered collection of unique elements.  

2. What are the most common methods of set and how to use them?

3. When to use sets versus lists?  
Sets are faster than lists when searching for a value, however, it's slower when iterating.  

4. How to iterate into a set?  
A simple loop could be used to iterate into a set.  A loop using enumerate could also be used for iteration.  Importing timeit from libraries could also help with iteration.  

5. What are dictionary and how to use them?  
A dictionary is a data structure used to associate a key to a value.  Similar to lists, a key is a single element.  Meanwhile, a value could be any type: list, list within a list or numbers.  

6. When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets?  
A dictionary is quite different from lists and sets, therefore, usage between the three depends on the situation.  A dictionary holds more information then both lists and sets.  

7. What is a key in a dictionary?  
A key is a string element in a dictionary that holds a value.  

8. How to iterate into a dictionary?  
Since a dictionary contains a key and its associated value, it's possible to iterate into a dictionary via the key or value or both.  

9. What is a lambda function?  
The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum tried to make the lambda, filter, map and reduce functions obsolete but without success with the exception of reduce.  Because list comprehension is a more efficient way to create small functions that are "throw-away" or "anonymous."  

10. What is map and reduce functions?  
A map function takes two arguments where the first is the name of the function and the second is its sequence.  A reduce function has been made obsolete because it's limited to associative operators.
